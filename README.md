# BallBlastClone

This is a prototype of BallBlast's clone. 

In the future I'm going to rewrite this project, add some new features, change graphic and gameplay. 

As it is prototype, the game doesn't have sounds, music and has some problem with balance. 
But It has fascinating gameplay and mechanics (include bonuses). 

Some screens from the game.

(I also haven't spent a lot of time for graphic ))) It'll be fixed in the future)
